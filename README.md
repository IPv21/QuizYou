# QuizYou
The Goal was to develope a functional quiz with attributes like a timer and the ability to log scores. I was unable to meet many of the criteria. I spent so much time just trying to get some of the basic functions 
down that I simply ran out of time. Not that I think more time would have helped much, as me staring at code that doesn't work isn't going to get me anywhere. I feel like someone showed me how to use a blowtorch
and a socket set then said 'now build me a racecar.' I am only now beginning to understand some of these tools, and even so knowing how to use them isn't gonna get your car built. I'm trying to get this done without 
taking code from others and i'm just not able to do it. I'm not the only one.
